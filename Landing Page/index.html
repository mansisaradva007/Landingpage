          <p>
            Fast forward to 2018, that orchard, now known as ‘Dhirubhai Ambani Lakhibag Amrayee’ is Asia’s best mango orchard with more than 1.3 lakh plants of over 200 species. Within last 6-7 years there has been a total transformation of the barren waste land into lush green countryside.Initially there was a lot of scepticism about success of mango at Jamnagar owing to high velocity winds, salinity in water and soil. However, with adoption of appropriate technology mango has become a success story. One cannot find such a large scale scientifically managed successful mango plantation anywhere in this part of the world.The mangoes produced in that orchard are of excellent quality and are widely exported at a global level. Reliance grows 127 varieties of mango in a 600-acre green belt at its Jamnagar refinery complex, looks to beat Israel and Brazil in productivity.
